User-friendly interface with smooth navigation and appealing design

## Technologies Used

The Diagonal App is built using the following technologies:

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications
- Context: React's built-in state management tool, used to manage application-level state
- Styled Components: A CSS-in-JS library for styling React components
- React Navigation: A routing and navigation library for React Native applications
- Jest: A JavaScript testing framework for unit testing

The Diagonal App showcases my ability to build a React Native application using various tools and libraries efficiently. By utilizing Context for state management, Styled Components for styling, React Navigation for navigation, and Jest for unit tests.
I have followed a lean approach, incorporating only the necessary dependencies. The application offers a user-friendly experience for fetching and displaying movies.
